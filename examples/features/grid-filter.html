            This example shows how to use the util `OGCFilter`, which helps to synchronize
            your map layers and feature-grid while using filters on the grid.<br>
            The util generates OGC compliant filters that can be attached to WMS
            or WFS requests in order to filter the map layers content in sync
            with the grid. Have a look at the `filterchange` listener to see the magic.
            <br><br>
            The map contains three layers for showcase reasons:<br>
            1.) A vectorlayer that is connected with the featuregrid and the map<br>
            2.) A WFS vectorlayer which gets filtered through an OGC-Filter which
                is derived from the utils `buildWfsGetFeatureWithFilter` method<br>
            3.) A WMS layer which gets filtered through an OGC-Filter which
                is derived from the utils `getOGCWMSFilterFromExtJSFilter` method

            Have a look at <a href="grid-filter.js">grid-filter.js</a> to see how this is
            done.

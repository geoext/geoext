## Why is Geoext dual-licensed?

See the Sencha official link for details: https://www.sencha.com/legal/open-source-faq/

## I still don't know which license applies, can you repeat?

GeoExt is GPLv3, but you have the right to use it and extend it with a
Sencha ExtJS Commercial License under BSD.

The license you choose depends on the license of the framework ExtJS you use
with it. If you are creating open source applications and you are using the GPL
v3 version of the Ext JS framework, then the appropriate GeoExt license is the
GPL v3 license for GeoExt. If you are creating closed source applications and
you are using the commercial version of the Ext JS framework, then the
appropriate GeoExt license is the BSD license for GeoExt, which can be combined
with the commercial version of Ext JS for a closed source application.

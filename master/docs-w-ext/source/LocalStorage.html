</span> * The LocalStorageProxy uses the new HTML5 localStorage API to save {@link Ext.data.Model Model} data locally on the
 * client browser. HTML5 localStorage is a key-value store (e.g. cannot save complex objects like JSON), so
 * LocalStorageProxy automatically serializes and deserializes data when saving and retrieving it.
 *
 * localStorage is extremely useful for saving user-specific information without needing to build server-side
 * infrastructure to support it. Let&#39;s imagine we&#39;re writing a Twitter search application and want to save the user&#39;s
 * searches locally so they can easily perform a saved search again later. We&#39;d start by creating a Search model:
 *
 *     Ext.define(&#39;Search&#39;, {
 *         fields: [&#39;id&#39;, &#39;query&#39;],
 *         extend: &#39;Ext.data.Model&#39;,
 *         proxy: {
 *             type: &#39;localstorage&#39;,
 *             id  : &#39;twitter-Searches&#39;
 *         }
 *     });
 *
 * Our Search model contains just two fields - id and query - plus a Proxy definition. The only configuration we need to
 * pass to the LocalStorage proxy is an {@link #id}. This is important as it separates the Model data in this Proxy from
 * all others. The localStorage API puts all data into a single shared namespace, so by setting an id we enable
 * LocalStorageProxy to manage the saved Search data.
 *
 * Saving our data into localStorage is easy and would usually be done with a {@link Ext.data.Store Store}:
 *
 *     //our Store automatically picks up the LocalStorageProxy defined on the Search model
 *     var store = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.data.Store&#39;, {
 *         model: &quot;Search&quot;
 *     });
 *
 *     //loads any existing Search data from localStorage
 *     store.load();
 *
 *     //now add some Searches
 *     store.add({query: &#39;Sencha Touch&#39;});
 *     store.add({query: &#39;Ext JS&#39;});
 *
 *     //finally, save our Search data to localStorage
 *     store.sync();
 *
 * The LocalStorageProxy automatically gives our new Searches an id when we call store.sync(). It encodes the Model data
 * and places it into localStorage. We can also save directly to localStorage, bypassing the Store altogether:
 *
 *     var search = Ext.create(&#39;Search&#39;, {query: &#39;Sencha Animator&#39;});
 *
 *     //uses the configured LocalStorageProxy to save the new Search to localStorage
 *     search.save();
 *
 * # Limitations
 *
 * If this proxy is used in a browser where local storage is not supported, the constructor will throw an error. A local
 * storage proxy requires a unique ID which is used as a key in which all record data are stored in the local storage
 * object.
 *
 * It&#39;s important to supply this unique ID as it cannot be reliably determined otherwise. If no id is provided but the
 * attached store has a storeId, the storeId will be used. If neither option is presented the proxy will throw an error.

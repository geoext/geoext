Release
=======

* Should be done by a user who has pushing rights to both github and npm
* Checkout and pull the current master (`git checkout master && git pull`)
* Run the release script (`npm run release`)
* The script will build, test, bump the version (you can choose), push to npm, create a git tag and a github release

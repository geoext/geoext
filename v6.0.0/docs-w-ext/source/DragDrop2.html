</span> * This plugin provides drag and drop functionality for a {@link Ext.grid.View GridView}.
 *
 * A specialized instance of {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone} and {@link Ext.dd.DropZone 
 * DropZone} are attached to the grid view.  The DropZone will participate in drops 
 * from DragZones having the same {@link #ddGroup} including drops from within the same 
 * grid.
 *
 * Note that where touch gestures are available, the `longpress` gesture will initiate
 * the drag in order that the `touchstart` may still be used to initiate a scroll.
 *
 * On platforms which implement the [Pointer Events standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/) (IE),
 * the `touchstart` event is usually claimed by the platform, however, this plugin
 * uses the `longpress` event to trigger drags, so `touchstart` will not initiate a scroll.
 * On these platforms, a two finger drag gesture will scroll the content, or a single
 * finger drag on an empty area of the view will scroll the content.
 *
 * During the drop operation a data object is passed to a participating DropZone&#39;s drop 
 * handlers.  The drag data object has the following properties:
 *
 * - **copy:** {@link Boolean} &lt;br&gt; The value of {@link #copy}.  Or `true` if 
 * {@link #allowCopy} is true **and** the control key was pressed as the drag operation 
 * began.
 * 
 * - **view:** {@link Ext.grid.View GridView} &lt;br&gt; The source grid view from which the 
 * drag originated
 * 
 * - **ddel:** HTMLElement &lt;br&gt; The drag proxy element which moves with the cursor
 * 
 * - **item:** HTMLElement &lt;br&gt; The grid view node upon which the mousedown event was 
 * registered
 * 
 * - **records:** {@link Array} &lt;br&gt; An Array of {@link Ext.data.Model Model}s 
 * representing the selected data being dragged from the source grid view
 *
 * By adding this plugin to a view, two new events will be fired from the client 
 * grid view as well as its owning Grid: `{@link #beforedrop}` and `{@link #drop}`.
 *
 *     @example
 *     var store = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.data.Store&#39;, {
 *         fields: [&#39;name&#39;],
 *         data: [
 *             [&quot;Lisa&quot;],
 *             [&quot;Bart&quot;],
 *             [&quot;Homer&quot;],
 *             [&quot;Marge&quot;]
 *         ],
 *         proxy: {
 *             type: &#39;memory&#39;,
 *             reader: &#39;array&#39;
 *         }
 *     });
 *     
 *     Ext.create(&#39;Ext.grid.Panel&#39;, {
 *         store: store,
 *         enableLocking: true,
 *         columns: [{
 *             header: &#39;Name&#39;,
 *             dataIndex: &#39;name&#39;,
 *             flex: true
 *         }],
 *         viewConfig: {
 *             plugins: {
 *                 ptype: &#39;gridviewdragdrop&#39;,
 *                 dragText: &#39;Drag and drop to reorganize&#39;
 *             }
 *         },
 *         height: 200,
 *         width: 400,
 *         renderTo: Ext.getBody()

</span> * **This class is never created directly. It should be constructed through associations in `Ext.data.Model`.**
 *
 * Associations enable you to express relationships between different {@link Ext.data.Model Models}. Consider
 * an ecommerce system where Users can place Orders - there is a one to many relationship between these Models,
 * one user can have many orders (including 0 orders). Here is what a sample implementation of this association
 * could look like. This example will be referred to in the following sections.
 *
 *     Ext.define(&#39;User&#39;, {
 *         extend: &#39;Ext.data.Model&#39;,
 *         fields: [{
 *             name: &#39;id&#39;,
 *             type: &#39;int&#39;
 *         }, &#39;name&#39;]
 *     });
 *
 *     Ext.define(&#39;Order&#39;, {
 *         extend: &#39;Ext.data.Model&#39;,
 *         fields: [{
 *             name: &#39;id&#39;,
 *             type: &#39;int&#39;
 *         }, {
 *             name: &#39;userId&#39;,
 *             type: &#39;int&#39;,
 *             reference: &#39;User&#39;
 *         }]
 *     });
 *
 * # Association Types
 *
 * Assocations can describe relationships in 3 ways:
 *
 * ## Many To One
 *
 * A single entity (`A`) has a relationship with many (`B`) entities. An example of this is
 * an ecommerce system `User` can have many `Order` entities.
 *
 * This can be defined using `Ext.data.schema.ManyToOne` for keyed associations, or 
 * `Ext.data.schema.HasMany` for keyless associations.
 * 
 * ## One To One
 *
 * A less common form of Many To One, a single entity (`A`) has a relationship with at most 1 entity (`B`). This is often
 * used when partitioning data. For example a `User` may have a single `UserInfo` object that stores extra
 * metadata about the user.
 *
 * This can be defined using `Ext.data.schema.OneToOne` for keyed associations, or 
 * `Ext.data.schema.HasOne` for keyless associations.
 * 
 * ## Many To Many
 *
 * An entity (`A`) may have a have a relationship with many (`B`) entities. That (`B`) entity may also
 * have a relationship with many `A` entities. For example a single `Student` can have many `Subject` entities and
 * a single `Subject` can have many `Student` entities.
 *
 * This can be defined using `Ext.data.schema.ManyToMany`. Many To Many relationships are readonly unless used with
 * a `Ext.data.Session`.
 *     
 *
 * # Keyed vs Keyless Associations
 *
 * Associations can be declared in 2 ways, which are outlined below.
 *
 * ## Keyed associations
 *
 * A keyed association relies on a field in the model matching the id of another model. Membership is driven by the key.
 * This is the type of relationship that is typically used in a relational database.
 * This is declared using the ||reference|| configuration on a model field. An example of this can be seen 
 * above for `User/Order`.
 *
 * # Keyless associations
 *
 * A keyless association relies on data hierarchy to determine membership. Items are members because they are
 * contained by another entity. This type of relationship is common with NoSQL databases.
 * formats. A simple example definition using `User/Order`:
 *
 *     Ext.define(&#39;User&#39;, {
 *         extend: &#39;Ext.data.Model&#39;,
 *         fields: [{
 *             name: &#39;id&#39;,
 *             type: &#39;int&#39;
 *         }, &#39;name&#39;],
 *         hasMany: &#39;Order&#39;
 *     });
 *
 *     Ext.define(&#39;Order&#39;, {
 *         extend: &#39;Ext.data.Model&#39;,
 *         fields: [{
 *             name: &#39;id&#39;,
 *             type: &#39;int&#39;
 *         }]
 *     });
 *
 * # Advantages of Associations
 * Assocations make it easier to work with Models that share a connection. Some of the main functionality includes:
 *
 * ## Generated Accessors/Setters
 *
 * Associated models will automatically generate named methods that allow for accessing the associated data.
 * The names for these are created using a {@link Ext.data.schema.Schema Schema}, to provide a consistent and
 * predictable naming structure.
 *
 * Using the example code above, there will be 3 generated methods:
 * + `User` will have an `orders()` function that returns a `Ext.data.Store` of`Orders`. 
 * + `Order` will have a `getUser` method which will return a `User` Model.
 * + `Order` will have a `setUser` method that will accept a `User` model or a key value.
 *
 * ## Nested Loading
 *
 * Nested loading is the ability to load hierarchical associated data from a remote source within a single request.
 * In the following example, each `User` in the `users` store has an `orders` store. Each `orders` store is populated
 * with `Order` models read from the request. Each `Order` model also has a reference back to the appropriate `User`.
 *
 *     // Sample JSON data returned by /Users
 *     [{
 *         &quot;id&quot;: 1,
 *         &quot;name&quot;: &quot;User Foo&quot;,
 *         &quot;orders&quot;: [{
 *             &quot;id&quot;: 101,
 *             &quot;userId&quot;: 1
 *         }, {
 *             &quot;id&quot;: 102,
 *             &quot;userId&quot;: 1
 *         }, {
 *             &quot;id&quot;: 103,
 *             &quot;userId&quot;: 1
 *         }]
 *     }, {
 *         &quot;id&quot;: 2,
 *         &quot;name&quot;: &quot;User Bar&quot;,
 *         &quot;orders&quot;: [{
 *             &quot;id&quot;: 201,
 *             &quot;userId&quot;: 2
 *         }, {
 *             &quot;id&quot;: 202,
 *             &quot;userId&quot;: 2
 *         }]
 *     }]
 *
 *     // Application code
 *     var users = new Ext.data.Store({
 *         model: &#39;User&#39;,
 *         proxy: {
 *             type: &#39;ajax&#39;,
 *             url: &#39;/Users&#39;
 *         }
 *     });
 *     users.load(function() {
 *         var user1 = users.first(),
 *             user2 = users.last(),
 *             orders1 = user1.orders(),
 *             orders2 = user2.orders();
 *
 *         // 3 orders, same reference back to user1
 *         console.log(orders1.getCount(), orders1.first().getUser() === user1);
 *         // 2 orders, same reference back to user2
 *         console.log(orders2.getCount(), orders2.first().getUser() === user2);
 *     });
 *
 * ## Binding
 *
 * Data binding using {@link Ext.app.ViewModel ViewModels} have functionality to be able to recognize
 * associated data as part of a bind statement. For example:
 * + `{user.orders}` binds to the orders store for a user.
 * + `{order.user.name}` binds to the name of the user taken from the order.
 * 
 *
 * # Association Concepts
 *
 * ## Roles
 *
 * The role is used to determine generated names for an association. By default, the role is generated from
 * either the field name (in a keyed association) or the model name. This naming follows a pattern defined by
 * the `Ext.data.schema.Namer`. To change a specific instance, an explicit role can be specified:
 *
 *     Ext.define(&#39;Thread&#39;, {
 *         extend: &#39;Ext.data.Model&#39;,
 *         fields: [&#39;id&#39;, &#39;title&#39;]
 *     });
 *
 *     Ext.define(&#39;Post&#39;, {
 *         extend: &#39;Ext.data.Model&#39;,
 *         fields: [&#39;id&#39;, &#39;content&#39;, {
 *             name: &#39;threadId&#39;,
 *             reference: {
 *                 type: &#39;Thread&#39;,
 *                 role: &#39;discussion&#39;,
 *                 inverse: &#39;comments&#39;
 *                 
 *             }
 *         }]
 *     });
 *
 * In the above example, the `Thread` will be decorated with a `comments` method that returns the store.
 * The `Post` will be decorated with `getDiscussion/setDiscussion` methods.
 *
 * ## Generated Methods
 *
 * Associations generate methods to allow reading and manipulation on associated data. 
 * 
 * On records that have a &quot;to many&quot; relationship, a single methods that returns a `Ext.data.Store` is created. 
 * See {@link #storeGetter}. On records that have a &quot;to one&quot; relationship, 2 methods are generated, a
 * {@link #recordGetter getter} and a {@link #recordSetter setter}.
 *
 * ## Reflexive
 *
 * Associations are reflexive. By declaring one &quot;side&quot; of the relationship, the other is automatically setup. In
 * the example below, there is no code in the `Thread` entity regarding the association, however by virtue of the
 * declaration in post, `Thread` is decorated with the appropriate infrastructure to participate in the association.
 *
 *     Ext.define(&#39;Thread&#39;, {
 *         extend: &#39;Ext.data.Model&#39;,
 *         fields: [&#39;id&#39;, &#39;title&#39;]
 *     });
 *
 *     Ext.define(&#39;Post&#39;, {
 *         extend: &#39;Ext.data.Model&#39;,
 *         fields: [&#39;id&#39;, &#39;content&#39;, {
 *             name: &#39;threadId&#39;,
 *             reference: &#39;Thread&#39;
 *         }]
 *     });
 *
 * ## Naming
 *
 * Referring to model names in associations depends on their {@link Ext.data.Model#entityName}. See
 * the &quot;Relative Naming&quot; section in the `Ext.data.schema.Schema` documentation.

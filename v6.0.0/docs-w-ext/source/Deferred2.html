<span id='Ext-promise-Deferred'>/**
</span> * Deferreds are the mechanism used to create new Promises. A Deferred has a single
 * associated Promise that can be safely returned to external consumers to ensure they do
 * not interfere with the resolution or rejection of the deferred operation.
 *
 * A Deferred is typically used within the body of a function that performs an asynchronous
 * operation. When that operation succeeds, the Deferred should be resolved; if that
 * operation fails, the Deferred should be rejected.
 *
 * Each Deferred has an associated Promise. A Promise delegates `then` calls to its
 * Deferred&#39;s `then` method. In this way, access to Deferred operations are divided between
 * producer (Deferred) and consumer (Promise) roles.
 *
 * When a Deferred&#39;s `resolve` method is called, it fulfills with the optionally specified
 * value. If `resolve` is called with a then-able (i.e.a Function or Object with a `then`
 * function, such as another Promise) it assimilates the then-able&#39;s result; the Deferred
 * provides its own `resolve` and `reject` methods as the onFulfilled or onRejected
 * arguments in a call to that then-able&#39;s `then` function. If an error is thrown while
 * calling the then-able&#39;s `then` function (prior to any call back to the specified
 * `resolve` or `reject` methods), the Deferred rejects with that error. If a Deferred&#39;s
 * `resolve` method is called with its own Promise, it rejects with a TypeError.
 *
 * When a Deferred&#39;s `reject` method is called, it rejects with the optionally specified
 * reason.
 *
 * Each time a Deferred&#39;s `then` method is called, it captures a pair of optional
 * onFulfilled and onRejected callbacks and returns a Promise of the Deferred&#39;s future
 * value as transformed by those callbacks.
 *

 * @since 6.0.0

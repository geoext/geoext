        * (defaults to false). If you set this to true you are responsible for implementing the appropriate
        * handling logic and restarting or discarding the batch as needed. There are different ways you could 
        * do this, e.g. by handling the batch&#39;s {@link #event-exception} event directly, or perhaps by overriding
        * {@link Ext.data.ProxyStore#onBatchException onBatchException} at the store level. If you do pause
        * and attempt to handle the exception you can call {@link #retry} to process the same operation again.

        * Note that {@link Ext.data.operation.Operation operations} are atomic, so any operations that may have succeeded
        * prior to an exception (and up until pausing the batch) will be finalized at the server level and will
        * not be automatically reversible. Any transactional / rollback behavior that might be desired would have
        * to be implemented at the application level. Pausing on exception will likely be most beneficial when
        * used in coordination with such a scheme, where an exception might actually affect subsequent operations
        * in the same batch and so should be handled before continuing with the next operation.
        * 
        * If you have not implemented transactional operation handling then this option should typically be left 
        * to the default of false (e.g. process as many operations as possible, and handle any exceptions
